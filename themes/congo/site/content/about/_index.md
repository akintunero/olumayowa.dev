# Olúmáyòwá A.

Hello! I am an experienced tech enthusiast with over 8 years of hands-on experience in telecommunications. My career kicked off as a Network Engineer, specialising in optimizing and maintaining complex network infrastructures. During this time, I explored the fibre optics technology after transitioning from wireless networking to exploring technologies like FTTx and eventually diving deep into Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM).

My journey into Submarine Optical Networks started with intensive training at the Ciena Learning Lab in London, UK. To further sharpen my expertise, I seized the opportunity to attend the Submarine Optical Communications summer school(a collaborative initiative by Google and Optica), held in Polvijari, Finland.

As a Lead Subsea Optical Networks Engineer, I spearheaded teams across 4 submarine cable landing stations spread across Africa and Europe. In this role, I facilitated the seamless transfer of over 800 Gbps of Internet traffic, leveraging subsea and land-based cable infrastructure.

Being someone who enjoys automating stuff, I decided to transition into DevOps which I have been doing for almost 2 years now.

I am also a member of [Optica](https://www.optica.org/), [Suboptic](https://suboptic.org/), [Internet Society](https://www.internetsociety.org/), and also a Cisco Insider Champion and an Instructor with  [The Cisco Network Academy](https://netacad.com).
