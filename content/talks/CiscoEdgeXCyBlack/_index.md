## Key Topics Covered

In addition to discussing my career journey and motivating aspiring network engineers, I delved into specialized topics related to submarine cable networks:

1. **Interconnecting Data Centers:** I explained how submarine cables play a crucial role in connecting data centers across continents, enabling high-speed, low-latency connectivity for large-scale data transfer. This connectivity is essential for applications such as backup, restore, caching, load balancing, and synchronization between data centers.

2. **Business Aspects of Submarine Networks:** I discussed the evolving business models in the submarine cable industry, including:
    - The shift from consortium to private cable ownership
    - The emergence of the condominium business model, where capacity ownership is sold to individual operators within the same cable
    - How this model can deliver attractive economies of scale and capital efficiency

3. **Global Connectivity:** I highlighted how submarine cables form the backbone of global internet infrastructure, carrying over 99% of intercontinental electronic communications traffic.

4. **Technological Advancements:** I touched on recent innovations in submarine networking, such as:
    - The adoption of coherent modems to maximize optical spectrum efficiency
    - The trend towards open submarine networks, similar to developments in terrestrial networking

5. **Impact on Edge Computing:** I explained how submarine cables are crucial in the worldwide edge ecosystem, enabling data exchange between businesses and end users at the edge.

## Impact and Networking

This event provided an excellent opportunity to share knowledge with aspiring tech professionals and emphasize the importance of understanding networking fundamentals in today's rapidly evolving technological landscape.
