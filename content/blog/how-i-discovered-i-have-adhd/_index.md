summary: "How I discovered I have ADHD and navigating life with it"

I always knew I was different from my peers, but I never knew why. I struggled with staying focused, organizing my tasks, and managing my time. I thought I was just lazy or incompetent. It wasn’t until I was diagnosed with ADHD that I realized there was a reason for my behavior and that I wasn’t alone.

ADHD stands for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, a neurodevelopmental condition that affects how people process information, regulate emotions, and control impulses. ADHD can affect various aspects of life, such as work, relationships, and health. Some of the common symptoms of ADHD are:

            Difficulty paying attention or staying on task

            Impulsivity or acting without thinking

            Hyperactivity or restlessness

            Disorganization or poor planning

            Low self-esteem or frustration

            Mood swings or irritability

            Anxiety or depression

I found out I had ADHD early 2023 after I lost my Dad and my mental health was a mess. My friend asked me to go into therapy and while in therapy I opened up on a lot that pointed to ADHD. I had it confirmed after two diagnoses. I felt terrible and it later dawned on me that most of my funny emotions and intermittent depression and wanting to always bottle in things when feeling messy and only confiding in strangers rather than family and close friends had been the case for so many years. Also, my attention span was terrible even when I got feedback on how smart I was.

I started my tech journey as a software engineer and left software for network engineering because I noticed I get distracted a lot and also I was always hyperactive whereas I needed the opposite to write those beautiful codes. I did network engineering as a career for some time and I got to have conversations with a few people in the software industry who made me know I have a creative mind and being back to expressing myself in codes or working around people writing the codes would be a beautiful transition for me. And my love for playing with technology, building stuff and making things work brought me to DevOps.

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development and IT operations to deliver software faster and more reliably. DevOps engineers are responsible for automating, testing, deploying, and monitoring software applications. Some of the skills and tools that DevOps engineers need to learn are:

Docker, a platform that allows you to create, run, and share applications using containers

Kubernetes, a system that orchestrates and manages clusters of containers

Terraform, a tool that enables you to define and provision infrastructure as code

Ansible, a tool that automates software configuration and deployment

Jenkins, a tool that automates the continuous integration and delivery of software

I have been able to learn a lot using online learning platforms and also getting to collaborate with other DevOps engineers. I enjoy learning new things and solving problems, which are some of the strengths of having ADHD. However, I also face some challenges, such as:

Procrastinating on tasks that I find boring or difficult

Getting overwhelmed by working on a lot of things at the same time

Struggling with documentation and communication

Having mood swings and feeling lonely or misunderstood

To cope with these challenges, I use some strategies and tools, such as:

Talking to friends in the tech space, psychotherapy, and speaking to people close to me

Breaking tasks into little chunks and timing myself to work on them

Using apps and calendars to organize and prioritize my work

Seeking feedback and support from my colleagues and mentors

Exercising and meditating to relax and recharge

Living with ADHD isn't a curse or a weakness; it's just a part of who I am and how I navigate the world. Sure, it comes with its set of challenges, but let me tell you, it's got its own perks too. Right from the moment I got that ADHD label, I decided to make it my ally rather than my adversary.

Understanding that I have ADHD has been a game-changer. It's like having a secret weapon that boosts my creativity, fuels my curiosity, and fans the flames of my passion for technology. And you know what's interesting? It even led me to rethink my relationship with coffee. I've been a certified coffee aficionado for years, but things got a bit too wild last year when my caffeine intake started causing hallucinations. So, a little recalibration was in order, and I dialed down the coffee craze.

I'm laying out my ADHD journey here not as a sob story but as a source of inspiration. If my tale can motivate others dealing with ADHD or contemplating a career change to go after their dreams, then sharing it is totally worth it.
