VM, on the other hand, is like a party hosted by another OS called the host OS. It uses a hypervisor (VMware, VirtualBox) to manage multiple virtual machines, each doing its own thing.\nThe Good, the Not-so-Good, and the Challenges of Bare Metal and VM\nBare Metal Basics #Pros:\nSmooth Performance: Your OS has the hardware all to itself, with no interruptions. It\u0026rsquo;s all about optimal performance and reliability.\nTop-Notch Security: Your OS stands alone, away from other OSs or VMs. Less drama, fewer risks.\nCons:\nNot Very Flexible: Can\u0026rsquo;t easily change hardware or add more resources. One OS at a time – pick your favourite.\nPricey Business: Needs its own hardware space, which can be costly. More hands-on maintenance too.\nVM Vibes\nPros:\nFlexible Fun: Can run on any hardware supporting the host OS and hypervisor. Mix and match OSs like a pro.\nBudget-Friendly: Shares hardware resources, reducing costs. Automation magic for the win.\nCons:\nPerformance Bumps: Host OS and hypervisor involvement can slow things down. It\u0026rsquo;s a party but with some hiccups.\nSecurity Considerations: Exposed to host OS risks. Relying on host OS security.\nUbuntu Journey: From Windows Farewell to Fresh Start\nSo, you\u0026rsquo;re feeling adventurous and want to switch from Windows to Ubuntu? Here\u0026rsquo;s your guide to a clean slate:\nDownload Ubuntu: Grab the desktop version that matches your laptop\u0026rsquo;s flavour (64-bit or 32-bit). Download Ubuntu Desktop\nGet Rufus: It\u0026rsquo;s the tool that puts ISO files on USB flash drives. Free, easy, and efficient. Download Rufus\nUSB Time: Plug in an 8GB+ USB flash drive and open Rufus.\nRufus Steps: Pick your USB, select the Ubuntu ISO file, and hit START. Let the writing commence!\nBoot Up: Restart your laptop, press the special key (usually F12, F10, or ESC), and choose USB as your boot star.\nUbuntu Unveiling: Click \u0026lsquo;Install Ubuntu,\u0026rsquo; follow the steps, and when you get to \u0026lsquo;Installation type,\u0026rsquo; choose \u0026ldquo;Erase disk and install Ubuntu\u0026rdquo; for a full wipeout. Or get creative with \u0026ldquo;Something else\u0026rdquo; for manual partitioning.\nFinish Line: Complete the installation, add your details, and voila! Reboot without the USB – Ubuntu is now running the show on your laptop.\n","date":null,"permalink":"/blog/installing-ubuntu-on-bare-metal/","section":"Blogs","summary":"No virtualisation, direct installation on Bare Metal","title":"Installing Ubuntu on a Bare metal"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Olúmáyòwá.dev","summary":"","title":"Olúmáyòwá.dev"},{"content":"I always knew I was different from my peers, but I never knew why. I struggled with staying focused, organizing my tasks, and managing my time. I thought I was just lazy or incompetent. It wasn’t until I was diagnosed with ADHD that I realized there was a reason for my behavior and that I wasn’t alone.\nADHD stands for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, a neurodevelopmental condition that affects how people process information, regulate emotions, and control impulses. ADHD can affect various aspects of life, such as work, relationships, and health. Some of the common symptoms of ADHD are:\nDifficulty paying attention or staying on task Impulsivity or acting without thinking Hyperactivity or restlessness Disorganization or poor planning Low self-esteem or frustration Mood swings or irritability Anxiety or depression I found out I had ADHD early 2023 after I lost my Dad and my mental health was a mess. My friend asked me to go into therapy and while in therapy I opened up on a lot that pointed to ADHD. I had it confirmed after two diagnoses. I felt terrible and it later dawned on me that most of my funny emotions and intermittent depression and wanting to always bottle in things when feeling messy and only confiding in strangers rather than family and close friends had been the case for so many years. Also, my attention span was terrible even when I got feedback on how smart I was.\nI started my tech journey as a software engineer and left software for network engineering because I noticed I get distracted a lot and also I was always hyperactive whereas I needed the opposite to write those beautiful codes. I did network engineering as a career for some time and I got to have conversations with a few people in the software industry who made me know I have a creative mind and being back to expressing myself in codes or working around people writing the codes would be a beautiful transition for me. And my love for playing with technology, building stuff and making things work brought me to DevOps.\nDevOps is a set of practices that combines software development and IT operations to deliver software faster and more reliably. DevOps engineers are responsible for automating, testing, deploying, and monitoring software applications. Some of the skills and tools that DevOps engineers need to learn are:\nDocker, a platform that allows you to create, run, and share applications using containers\nKubernetes, a system that orchestrates and manages clusters of containers\nTerraform, a tool that enables you to define and provision infrastructure as code\nAnsible, a tool that automates software configuration and deployment\nJenkins, a tool that automates the continuous integration and delivery of software\nI have been able to learn a lot using online learning platforms and also getting to collaborate with other DevOps engineers. I enjoy learning new things and solving problems, which are some of the strengths of having ADHD. However, I also face some challenges, such as:\nProcrastinating on tasks that I find boring or difficult\nGetting overwhelmed by working on a lot of things at the same time\nStruggling with documentation and communication\nHaving mood swings and feeling lonely or misunderstood\nTo cope with these challenges, I use some strategies and tools, such as:\nTalking to friends in the tech space, psychotherapy, and speaking to people close to me\nBreaking tasks into little chunks and timing myself to work on them\nUsing apps and calendars to organize and prioritize my work\nSeeking feedback and support from my colleagues and mentors\nExercising and meditating to relax and recharge\nLiving with ADHD isn\u0026rsquo;t a curse or a weakness; it\u0026rsquo;s just a part of who I am and how I navigate the world. Sure, it comes with its set of challenges, but let me tell you, it\u0026rsquo;s got its own perks too. Right from the moment I got that ADHD label, I decided to make it my ally rather than my adversary.\nUnderstanding that I have ADHD has been a game-changer. It\u0026rsquo;s like having a secret weapon that boosts my creativity, fuels my curiosity, and fans the flames of my passion for technology. And you know what\u0026rsquo;s interesting? It even led me to rethink my relationship with coffee. I\u0026rsquo;ve been a certified coffee aficionado for years, but things got a bit too wild last year when my caffeine intake started causing hallucinations. So, a little recalibration was in order, and I dialed down the coffee craze.\nI\u0026rsquo;m laying out my ADHD journey here not as a sob story but as a source of inspiration. If my tale can motivate others dealing with ADHD or contemplating a career change to go after their dreams, then sharing it is totally worth it. If you\u0026rsquo;ve got questions or thoughts, drop them in the comments. And hey, if this little snippet resonates with you, consider sharing it with your pals.\n","date":null,"permalink":"/blog/how-i-discovered-i-have-adhd/","section":"Blogs","summary":"How I discovered I have ADHD and navigating life with it","title":"How I Discovered I Have ADHD and What It Means for My Tech Career"},{"content":"Olúmáyòwá A. #Telecommunications expert, DevOps enthusiast, and passionate advocate for African youth empowerment with over a decade of experience in network engineering and submarine optical networks.
