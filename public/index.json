A virtual machine (VM), on the other hand, is like a party hosted by another OS (the host OS). It uses a hypervisor (e.g., VMware, VirtualBox) to manage multiple virtual machines, each operating independently.\nThe Good, the Not-So-Good, and the Challenges of Bare Metal and VM #Bare Metal Basics #Pros: # Smooth Performance: Your OS has full access to hardware resources, ensuring optimal performance and reliability. Top-Notch Security: Your OS is isolated from other OSs or VMs, reducing security risks. Cons: # Limited Flexibility: Changing hardware or adding resources isn’t as easy. You’re limited to running one OS at a time. Higher Costs: Dedicated hardware can be expensive, and maintenance requires more hands-on effort. VM Vibes #Pros: # Greater Flexibility: Can run multiple OSs on the same hardware, making it easy to switch environments. Cost-Effective: Shares hardware resources efficiently, reducing costs. Supports automation for better management. Cons: # Performance Overhead: Host OS and hypervisor introduce some latency, potentially affecting performance. Security Considerations: VMs depend on the security of the host OS, making them more vulnerable to host-related risks.

I struggled with staying focused, organizing my tasks, and managing my time. I thought I was just lazy or incompetent. It wasn’t until I was diagnosed with ADHD that I realized there was a reason for my behavior and that I wasn’t alone.\nUnderstanding ADHD #ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects how people process information, regulate emotions, and control impulses. It impacts various aspects of life, including work, relationships, and mental health. Some common symptoms of ADHD include:\nDifficulty paying attention or staying on task Impulsivity or acting without thinking Hyperactivity or restlessness Disorganization or poor planning Low self-esteem or frustration Mood swings or irritability Anxiety or depression My Diagnosis and Realization #I found out I had ADHD in early 2023 after losing my dad, which took a serious toll on my mental health. A friend encouraged me to go to therapy, and during those sessions, I opened up about my struggles. My therapist suspected ADHD, and after undergoing two diagnostic assessments, it was confirmed.\nAt first, I felt terrible. Then, it dawned on me—many of the emotions I struggled with, including intermittent depression, bottling up feelings, and confiding in strangers rather than close friends, had been present for years. My attention span was terrible, even though people often complimented me on how smart I was.\nMy Tech Journey with ADHD #I started my tech journey as a software engineer but later transitioned to Network engineering. I noticed that I often got distracted while coding, and my hyperactivity made it challenging to sit still for long hours.

It aligns perfectly with my skills and interests. Some of the key tools and technologies I work with include:\nDocker – For creating, running, and sharing applications using containers Kubernetes – For orchestrating and managing clusters of containers Terraform – For defining and provisioning infrastructure as code Ansible – For automating software configuration and deployment Jenkins – For continuous integration and software delivery I’ve learned a lot through online platforms and by collaborating with other DevOps engineers. My ADHD gives me strengths like creativity, problem-solving, and a deep passion for learning. However, it also presents some challenges.\nChallenges I Face with ADHD in Tech #Despite the advantages, ADHD also brings struggles in my professional life, including:\nProcrastination – I tend to delay tasks that I find boring or difficult. Overwhelm – Juggling multiple projects can quickly become chaotic. Documentation \u0026amp; Communication – I struggle with writing detailed documentation and sometimes find it hard to express my thoughts clearly. Mood Swings \u0026amp; Isolation – I occasionally feel misunderstood or lonely. Strategies That Help Me Cope #To navigate these challenges, I use several strategies and tools:\nTherapy \u0026amp; Conversations – Talking to friends in tech, attending psychotherapy, and confiding in close people. Task Management – Breaking tasks into smaller chunks and using timers to stay focused. Productivity Tools – Using apps and calendars to organize and prioritize work. Feedback \u0026amp; Mentorship – Seeking advice from mentors and colleagues to stay on track. Self-Care – Exercising, meditating, and ensuring I get enough rest. Embracing ADHD as My Strength #Living with ADHD isn\u0026rsquo;t a curse or a weakness—it’s just a part of who I am. Sure, it presents challenges, but it also fuels my creativity, curiosity, and passion for technology.\nOne interesting realization I had after my diagnosis was how caffeine affected me. I\u0026rsquo;ve been a coffee lover for years, but in 2023, I had to reduce my intake because it started causing hallucinations. It was a necessary adjustment, and I’m learning to listen to my body more.\nWhy I’m Sharing My Story #I’m sharing my ADHD journey not as a sob story but as an inspiration. If my experience can help others struggling with ADHD or those considering a career transition, then opening up about it is worth it.\nIf you have thoughts or questions, drop them in the comments. If this post resonates with you, feel free to share it with others.\nADHD is not a limitation; it’s a different way of thinking, and it’s a superpower when harnessed correctly.\n","date":null,"permalink":"/blog/how-i-discovered-i-have-adhd/","section":"","summary":"How I discovered I have ADHD and navigating life with it","title":"How I Discovered I Have ADHD and What It Means for My Tech Career"},{"content":"Olúmáyòwá A. #Telecommunications expert, DevOps enthusiast, and passionate advocate for African youth empowerment with over a decade of experience in network engineering and submarine optical networks.
